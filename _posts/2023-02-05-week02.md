title: Week 2 About Code of Conduct and Web Extension Project

# Code of Conduct Activity
## Part 1
#### Visit the [code of conduct document](https://go.dev/conduct) for the [Go project](https://go.dev/). Read the document carefully. In your own words explain the benefits of having such a document for a project. Do you think other projects would benefit from having such a document?
The code of conduct document provides basic yet clear guidelines for acceptable behaviors. These are essentially common social manners usually expected without being said explicitly. However, since it's an online space, I think there is a benefit in having a document that explicitly lists expected behaviors. Not only people who wish to participate in the project can know what they can or cannot do, but also the document could be an evidence when there is a situation where someone needs to be kicked out for violations.

#### Go to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/) website. Find two differences between the two code of conduct documents. Explain why the Go project might have made those changes.
The Contributor Covenant provides a template for a code of conduct document. The Go project filled in the blanks in the template with their specific names and emails and elaborated on some sections to reflect their own philosophy.

#### The Contributor Covenant website has a list of projects that adapted their code of conduct. Find the code of conduct document for [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). This document has different structure and content than the one for the Go project. Explain why that is.
This is the link for [Code of Conduct of Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php). The one for Eclipse has extra sections that don't exist for the one for Go project: Investigation of Potential Code Violations, Actions, No Retaliation, and Amendments. Eclipse is putting more weight on explaining in case of violation, its report, and the procedure taken after being reported than Go project. This may be because Eclipse has a much larger population of contributors compared to Go project. Inevitably, there will be much more conflicts for which a clear guideline is needed to resolve the issues.


## Part 2
#### Visit the [code of conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct) document for the [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org/) project. Compare it to the code of conduct for the Go project. Is this based on another code of conduct?
The document is based on the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/governance/code-of-conduct). Unlike the one for Go project, it only shows the values the community strives for. It focuses more on ensuring diversity and actively seeked participation and less on explaining about leadership, authority, or responsibility.


## Part 3
#### Pick an open source project. Find its code of conduct document. If you find it, compare it to the two "templates" that you looked at in parts 1 and 2. If the project does not have a code of conduct document, write a proposal for such a document.
This is the link for the [code of conduct for Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Just like the ones in part 1, Node.js follows the Contributor Covenant for its code of conduct document. So, it is clearly different from the one for Sugar Labs adapted from the Ubuntu Code of Conduct that focuses on ensuring diversity and actively seeked participation for mutual advantage and enjoyment. Instead, the Contributor Covenant focuses on creating a harassment-free experience. The difference between the one for Node.js and the ones for Go project and Eclipse is that Node.js uses version 2.0. This version includes enforcement guidelines which tell the specific types of consequences for any action in violation of their code of conduct: correction, warning, temporary ban, and permanent ban.



# Add-On Project
It was my first time working with web extensions. Following the first and second tutorials, I was able to easily create simple extensions and gain some basic knowledge about extensions. With background JavaScript understanding, learning the basics of web extensions wasn't too challenging. After some technical understanding, I explored the procedures of creating new extension by looking into LICENSE, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in MDN WebExtension repository. Then, my team looked at a real example of a web extension. We chose an extension called Tabby Cat to look deeper into its details. Lastly, we had to come up with an idea to make our own extension, and we decided that we wanted something rather simple since no one in our team had any experience with web extensions before.
