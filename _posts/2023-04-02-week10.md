title: Week 10 Progress with the Group Project

After hours, I figured out that the reason why I had errors for dependencies installation for MindsDB in the virtual environment was the encoding. The machine literally hadn't been able to read because the system locale was set to Korean although my computer's default language was English. <!--more--> The solution was very simple: go to 'Administrative' under 'Region' in Control Panel and enable the button for 'Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support' under 'Language for non-Unicode programs'. This effectively got rid of the 'UnicodeDecodeError: cp949', then I was able to install MindsDB itself. After successful installation, it could be run and pop open the editor in port 47334.

All of the group members also participated in the monthly community call that takes place on every last Friday of the month through Zoom. There were a total of 30 people in the meeting and it was led entirly by the maintainers, introducing ways to connect to a MindsDB server using CMD and some informations about the new hackathon they organized. The meeting was pretty short, casual, and certainly welcoming any new people to the project.
