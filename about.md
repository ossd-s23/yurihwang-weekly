Hey everyone! This is Yuri Hwang!
I'm currently a senior studying CS at NYU, graduating this spring.

### More Information

I love New York City, traveling around and discovering new places I haven't been to. I also love to go to museums and to watch Broadway musicals or the Met operas.
I am a huge foodie, and I love to cook and explore different cuisines.
I'm also fluent in Korean! I was born and raised for about 10 years in South Korea, and I moved to Georgia where I'm still living.
